# List of sysexts and versions to build by the release Github Action.
#
# Add a combination of
#
#<sysextname> <version>
#
#, one per line. <version> must be a version string returned by
#
#  ./bakery.sh list <sysextname>
#
# as extensions may use subtly different version strings, e.g. "1.33.2" vs "v1.33.2".
#
# You can also use
#
#<sysextname> latest
#
# to build the latest (i.e. highest version number) release(s).
